                        <br>

                        <h3>What is OuchCoin and what are its main features?</h3><br>
                        <p>OuchCoin is a BEP-20 token designed with burning functionality, crafted for entertainment and
                            meme purposes. Its primary attributes include a burn tax applied to each transaction and
                            penalties imposed on inactive wallets.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What does it mean when a coin is burned?</h3><br>
                        <p>When a coin is burned, it undergoes a process where it is sent to an address from which it
                            cannot be retrieved, effectively removing it from circulation permanently.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>How does the burn mechanism work?</h3><br>
                        <p>Every transaction involving OuchCoin entails a 1% burn tax, leading to a portion of coins
                            being permanently taken out of circulation. Additionally, inactive wallets face penalties
                            during transactions.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What happens if a wallet remains inactive for over a year?</h3><br>
                        <p>If a wallet remains inactive for more than a year, the entire balance must be transferred in
                            a single transaction. This mechanism ensures that users pay a penalty on all coins
                            held, rather than just the amount of the recent transaction. Attempting to transfer less
                            than the entire balance will result in a transaction failure.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the penalty for inactivity?</h3><br>
                        <p>The penalty for inactivity involves a 5% burn tax per inactive year, capped at a
                            maximum penalty of 25%. This structure aims to incentivize users to maintain activity and
                            discourage prolonged periods of inactivity.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the burn exemption?</h3><br>
                        <p>If you are transferring less than 100 coins, no burn tax is applied. This exemption is
                            intended to encourage sharing and enable wallets to remain active without having to deplete
                            their coin reserves.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the penalty exemption?</h3><br>
                        <p>If a wallet holds less than 100 coins, it is not subjected to a penalty and can remain
                            inactive for longer periods of time.</p>

                            associated with wallet inactivity. By acquiring OuchCoin, users acknowledge and accept these

                        <h3>📜 Rules 📜</h3><hr/>
                        <p>1. Hold onto your seats, folks! It's a one-drop-per-address affair. We're doing our best to
                            keep those crypto whales at bay. Emphasis on "trying"!</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>2. Ready to fuel the fire? Send BNB to cover transaction fees to this address:
                        </p><br>
                        <div class="canvas-container"><canvas id="qrcode2" class="qrcode"></canvas></div><br>

                        <p>3. Need one last favor from ya! Let's get the word out with a tweet
                            using this template! 🐦📢</p><br>
                        <div class="card tweet">@ouchcoinhq 🔥 Sent my BNB for the #OuchCoin airdrop! Ready to fuel the
                            flames and feel the burn! 🔥<br><br>
                            Let's crank up the heat with #OuchCoin! 🚀<br><br>
                            [Your BSC main net address]<br><br>
                            #BSC #MemeCoin $ouch #Binance #cryto #cryptocurrency
                        </div>
                        <p>Note: BSC address should be the same address that sent BNB for the airdrop.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>4. Keep your wallet close! The airdrop circles right back to where it started—your BSC
                            address that sent BNB for Airdrop. Don't blink until it lands!</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>5. Buckle up! Airdrop launches only when every slot's taken, keeping the market cool and
                            manipulations in check.</p>
