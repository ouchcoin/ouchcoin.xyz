                            This contract is for a cryptocurrency called OuchCoin and listed below are some of it's key points.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>1. **Transaction Fees**:</strong> Every time someone sends OuchCoin to someone
                            else, a small part (1%) of
                            the coins being sent is destroyed (burned). This is called a "burn tax".
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>2. **Penalties for Inactivity**:</strong> If someone holds onto OuchCoin without
                            using it for over a
                            year, they're charged a penalty when they do eventually use it. If they haven't done
                            anything
                            with their coins for over a year and have more than 100 coins, they have to transfer all
                            of
                            their coins at once. This means they'll pay the penalty on all the coins they have, not
                            just the
                            ones they're currently sending. The penalty starts at 5% per year of inactivity but
                            can't go
                            higher than 25%.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>4. **Events**:</strong> Whenever coins are burned
                            the contract records it
                            in an event, so anyone can see what's happening.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>5. **Supply and Name**:</strong> The initial supply of OuchCoin is 420.69
                            trillion coins, and the symbol
                            for the coin is "OUCH".
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>6. **Disclaimer**:</strong> The contract emphasizes that OuchCoin is just for
                            fun and shouldn't be
                            treated like a serious investment. It's meant for entertainment purposes only, and
                            people should
                            be careful with their money.

                        <p>Note: Instead of one year, the timeframe for inactivity is set to 5 hours. This facilitates
                            quicker testing of penalty functions.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h3>What is OuchCoin and what are its main features?</h3><br>
                        <p>OuchCoin is a BEP-20 token designed with burning functionality, crafted for entertainment and
                            meme purposes. Its primary attributes include a burn tax applied to each transaction and
                            penalties imposed on inactive wallets.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What does it mean when a coin is burned?</h3><br>
                        <p>When a coin is burned, it undergoes a process where it is sent to an address from which it
                            cannot be retrieved, effectively removing it from circulation permanently.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>How does the burn mechanism work?</h3><br>
                        <p>Every transaction involving OuchCoin entails a 1% burn tax, leading to a portion of coins
                            being permanently taken out of circulation. Additionally, inactive wallets face penalties
                            during transactions.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What happens if a wallet remains inactive for over a year?</h3><br>
                        <p>If a wallet remains inactive for more than a year, the entire balance must be transferred in
                            a single transaction. This mechanism ensures that users pay a penalty on all coins
                            held, rather than just the amount of the recent transaction. Attempting to transfer less
                            than the entire balance will result in a transaction failure.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the penalty for inactivity?</h3><br>
                        <p>The penalty for inactivity involves a 5% burn tax per inactive year, capped at a
                            maximum penalty of 25%. This structure aims to incentivize users to maintain activity and
                            discourage prolonged periods of inactivity.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the burn exemption?</h3><br>
                        <p>If you are transferring less than 100 coins, no burn tax is applied. This exemption is
                            intended to encourage sharing and enable wallets to remain active without having to deplete
                            their coin reserves.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What is the penalty exemption?</h3><br>
                        <p>If a wallet holds less than 100 coins, it is not subjected to a penalty and can remain
                            inactive for longer periods of time.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What should users consider before acquiring OuchCoin?</h3><br>
                        <p>Users should be mindful of the burn tax applied to every transaction and the penalties
                            associated with wallet inactivity. By acquiring OuchCoin, users acknowledge and accept these
                            features, understanding that any financial transactions or decisions made are undertaken at
                            their own risk.</p>
